# Sega Saturn SGL Graphics Tutorial examples

Just a repository based on the SGL Libraries examples of Sega Saturn. Growing the repo at the time I learn from the manual.

The idea is to reach a point when I can do my own homebrew game based on SGL + Jo Engine

The compiler setup is very similar to the Jo Engine setup and it uses Johannes Fetz's cue maker. 

Compiler setup taken from XL2's Sonic Z-treme code: https://github.com/Maxime-XL2/SONIC-Z-TREME

Following the Sega Saturn SGL Graphics Developer manual found in: https://antime.kapsi.fi/sega/docs.html
